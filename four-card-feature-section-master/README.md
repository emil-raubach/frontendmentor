## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- I refreshed myself on CSS grid basics as well as how to make a responsive grid - grid areas for the win!
- I learned how to use the `clamp()` function to scale fonts based on the viewport width and not needing to rely on media queries.
- Just continusing to learn HTML and CSS at a higher level and come up with my own standard practices and overall workflow for creating a webpage.
- How to use svg images and place them inside a card UI element.

### Continued development

So far as continued development, I plan to keep learning how to use CSS Grid and Flexbox as for layout and responsive design. I also like the approach to responsive design I have found from reading some articles from some talented web devs that use no media queries but instead have a cool system that really lets the browser handle the changes based on viewport size.

### Useful resources

- [MDN docs for the clamp function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clamp) - Helpful description of the CSS clamp() function.
- [An Interactive Guide to CSS Grid](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/interactive-guide-to-grid/) - Really cool, interactive and well-written guide to CSS Grid basics.

### Links

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Continued development

Some takeaways from this challenge is to start to have my own workflow and method for tackling the layout and styling of a website. Things like "boilerplate" code for resets, how I use CSS variables to create more resusable styles, etc. I also need to keep improving on responsive design and look into how to approach it from the so-called "mobile first" perspective.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I am getting better at understanding some of the basic HTML and CSS practices to go a beyond just getting a solution and being able to have a plan for how to approach a project. I have a better idea of how to approach creating and styling a basic UI element like a card using a more structured and methodical approach to the code.

### Continued development

I still struggle with understanding all of the CSS properties and how they could be used to make the stylesheet more standardized and reusable. I have a basic idea of responsive design, but it's mainly around the sizing of elements and layout like changing from flex row to column at a particular breakpoint. Changing the typograpy is something I think will take more time and practice. I didn't really take advantage of Flexbox or CSS grid in this project as it seemed like it would be easy enough without it, but I would like to try the layout again with these methods.

### Useful resources

- [box shadow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow) - I was struggling to get the box shadow looking right, so I had to refresh my memory of all of the different inputs and forms of this property.

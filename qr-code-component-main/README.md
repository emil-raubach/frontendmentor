## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Although this is considered a very basic exercise, and I did it once before a while back, there's still a lot of things I learned.

One of the main things is just how to structure the HTML so it makes sense when styling. It can be difficult to see a design or have an idea for a page and know how to layout the HTML so you can apply the appropriate styles without having to go back and make too many changes. Have a good CSS naming scheme is really helpful as well. I am trying to use BEM currently as it seems to be pretty logical and can be used partially if you want to.

### Continued development

For future development, I plan to focus on basic layout using flexbox and css grid as I seem to be fairly weak in that area. Also, I really like having a design file to work with rather than just trying to guess at sizing, etc. So I downloaded Figma and plan to learn the basics of that program to help in cases where a design is provided.

### Useful resources

- [BEM](https://en.bem.info/methodology/) - This a great website to learn the BEM method.

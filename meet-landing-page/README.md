### Links

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- BEM
- Sass

### Continued development

I need to keep learning how to layout a website using Flexbox and CSS Grid while keeping it responsive. I had a hard time with this challenge for some reason even though it's not too complicated. I tried using Sass for this project, and it may have added to much additional complexity at this point versus regular CSS.
